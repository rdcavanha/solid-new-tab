# Solid New Tab
A minimalistic new tab page with customizable solid background color for Chromium browsers.
Also works on icognito idependently!

Note: this extension only requires the `storage` permission to save the color that you choose. Nothing else is requested. There is not tracking, no ads, nothing.

## Installing
This extension is not published on Chrome Web Store as I don't feel like giving 5 dollars to Google just to register as developer.

Please consider donating if you would like to see it published:

Nonetheless, you can download it from GitHub and manually install it on your Chromium browser:
1. Download the zipped extension and extract it (or clone the project - preferred method) to any directory of your preference
2. Open the Extensions page on your browser by entering `chrome://extensions` in your address bar
3. On the top-right corner of the page, toggle `Developer mode` on
4. On the top-left corner of the page click on `Load unpacked` and choose the extension's folder (please note that if you delete or move the extension's folder, the extension WILL be removed from your browser as well)

## Usage

1. To access the `Options` page and set your desired color, right on the extensions icon next to the address bar and choose `Options`
2. Choose your color and click on `Save`
3. Open a new tab. Voila!

You can also set a complete different color for your incognito windows:

2. Click on `Details` for the Solid New Tab extension
3. Toggle `Allow in Private` on
4. Open an incognito window and repeat the steps to choose a color
